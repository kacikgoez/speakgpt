# SpeakGPT

Allows you to talk to ChatGPT. Initally I used ElevenLabs, but their pricing model is limited to a specific number of words, so not feasible for extended use.
This is just a mockup code I wrote to see how feasible it is to connect ElevenLabs with ChatGPT. I used threading to generate multiple sentences, but ElevenLabs
won't allow it. Maybe StabilityAI or someone else will release a trained SoundStorm model. I've also added Microsoft TTS.
